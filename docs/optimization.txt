Ideas
=====================
Framebuffer should take volumes > 100^3
Store unsigned data positions
Precalculate shader variables
Rotation with quaternions
Transfer function
GUI
Clean main
Lower rendering quality at interaction
Nyquist sampling rate >= 2 samples per voxel (adaptive sampling)

Finished
=====================
Jump directly to cube (Render frag-positions as colors vs SDF for unit cube)
Remove unnecessary uniforms
random start depends on stepsize
Bounding Cube

Comments
===================================
2D_TEXTURE LONG => 126^3
2D_TEXTURE SQUARE => 635^3
3D_TEXTURE  => 16000^3 (slow)

pass pixels by reference => huge speed gain
