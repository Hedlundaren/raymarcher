Ideas
=====================
Store unsigned data positions
Precalculate shader variables
Rotation with quaternions
Framebuffer should take volumes > 100^3
Transfer function
GUI
Clean main

In Progress
=====================
Jump directly to cube (Render frag-positions as colors vs SDF for unit cube)


Finished
=====================
Remove unnecessary uniforms
random start depends on stepsize
Bounding Cube
